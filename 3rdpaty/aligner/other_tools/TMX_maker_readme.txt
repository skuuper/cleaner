TMX maker version 2.2
by András Farkas

This should be pretty self-explanatory: the TMX maker is basically the TMX generation part of the aligner in a separate program. As such, it uses the same setup file (LF_aligner_setup.txt).
If you do an alignment with LF aligner, you won't need the separate TMX maker; it's designed to create TMX files from tab delimited files from different sources.
The TMX maker uses the aligner's setup file so make the appropriate settings there.
