mansegment.perl Version 1.2

mansegment.perl is a Chinese segmenter for both GB and BIG5 as long as
the cooresponding word frqenuency dictionary is used.

Run as: mansegment.perl [dictfile] < infile > outfile

Version 1.2 is updated by Oleg Urzhumtcev to comply with new version of 
Perl interpreter.

Version 1.0 was written by Zhibiao Wu at LDC on April 12 1999. Version
1.1 is an updated version by Xiaoyi Ma at LDC in March, 2003. The
changes are:

- simplified code
- regenerated database to be compatible with perl5

Algorithm: Dynamic programming to find the path which has the highest 
multiple of word probability, the next word is selected from the longest
phrase.

dictfile is a two column text file, first column is the frequency, 
second column is the word. The program will change the file into a dbm 
file in the first run. So be sure to remove the dbm file if you have a
newer version of the text file.
