In the last 20 years, China's science and technology research has made  achievements which have gained the attention of the people of the world.  
However, many scientists and editors have come to feel even more that the  development of China's science and technology magazines has fallen far behind  the development of China's science and technology itself.       
China's science and technology publishers have borne the dual pressures of a  surplus number of science and technology magazines and an excessive emphasis on  foreign appraisal systems.       
At present China has almost 4,300 kinds of science and technology magazines,  with almost one or more kinds of publications for each university, research  institute, and professional association. 
Limited inputs and the dispersion of  sources have to a great extent constrained the raising of the academic level of  science and technology publications, thus causing to a certain extent the  lagging of China's science and technology magazines behind the development of  international science and technology magazines.       
In recent years, some domestic departments in charge of scientific research  have shown a notably excessive emphasis on evaluating in terms of how many  articles are published abroad. 
The evaluation of scientific research personnel  by many scientific research departments has frequently indiscriminately  considered the publishing of one article abroad as equal to publishing one or  more articles domestically, resulting to a great degree in attracting Chinese  academic articles to publishing abroad. 
According to the example of the  Scientific Citation Index (SCI CDE) of the internationally renowned citation  system of the United States' Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), the  number of academic articles published by Chinese scientists received by the ISI  in 1983 and 1997 numbered 3,475 and 10,033 articles, respectively. 
Among  these, the Chinese scientific and technical periodicals published respectively  accounted for 1,502 and 1,708 articles. 
This means that in a period of 15  years, the number of articles published in scientific and technical periodicals  domestically in China fell relatively by 26.2 percent.       
The overemphasis on publishing abroad is not only divergent from objective  reality, but also is not advantageous to the development of China's scientific  and technical journals. 
This is because the compilation and publication that  comes out of the ISI's citation indexing database is aimed at providing  services for scientific and technical information, and the items cited do not  all directly affect the concrete substance of articles; so as a type of  statistical analysis product, the influence itself of the data does not have an  academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for  evaluating academic publications. 
In addition, the ISI database manifests a  notable regional disparity in regard to the number of publications sourced in  regard to certain regions. 
The number of publications sourced to certain  countries or regions in the ISI database is not in conformity with the  scientific and technological levels or overall power of certain countries or  regions.       
The reason we believe that the development of domestic science and technical  magazines is extremely important is that, as a window for revealing scientific  research results, science and technical periodicals play the dual roles of  simultaneous exchange and promoting technological development. 
If China's  high-level scientific research results are for the most part published in  foreign science and technical journals, due to the factors of cost and channels  of distribution, it will be difficult to see that these results receive  simultaneous first reporting domestically.       
To address the objective reality of China's scientific and technical  journals, the scientific funding magazine department of the National Commission  for Natural Sciences Funding, in April 1999 organized and convened an  international symposium on "Raising the Overall Quality of China's Scientific  and Technical Periodicals". 
The scientists and personages from publishing  circles who participated in the symposium concluded for the most part that in  the future, the development of China's scientific and technical magazines most  certainly must follow "planned birth," with the focus on raising quality. 
In  addition, the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding and the Chinese  Science Association have begun a joint provision of set amounts of funding to  100 outstanding science and technical periodicals. 
This definitely will  promote the further heightening of the quality of these magazines.       
In regard to increasing the exposure of publications, the investment into  China's science and technical publications has been by far insufficient. 
At  present, many foreign academic journals, because they have established  specialized web pages on the Internet, not only have provided weekly content  for articles to be published, but some have even set up links to vast  information databases. 
These methods undoubtedly will expand the influence of  the publications as well as the frequency with which the articles in the  publications are quoted. 
At the same time, these methods will also increase  subscribers. 
In these respects, China's domestic publications at present  include only a minute number of scientific and technical journals, which are in  an initial stage of development and await strengthening.       
China's scientific and technical journals should additionally fully pay  attention to publicity and distribution work. 
Compared with the complete  marketing networks and contacts and advanced advertising methods employed by  foreign publishers, the level of China's distribution work for its scientific  and technical periodicals is still relatively backward, and this is extremely  obvious in the existing 148 English editions of scientific and technical  publications. 
At present, China's majority of English editions of scientific  and technical publications have only some tens of editions that are subscribed  to by foreigners, and even these few are not sufficiently marketed in foreign  distribution channels. 
If China's English- edition scientific and technical  publications unite together and seek suitable, highly efficient partners  abroad, they might find in the near term some fairly feasible and effective  foreign avenues of distribution.   
As for the situation at present, China's scientific and technical  periodicals must raise their overall quality and increase the progress of their  international contacts, not only requiring the arduous efforts of editorial  departments, but even more requiring the close attention and large-scale  support of scientific and technical departments and people in scientific  circles.
